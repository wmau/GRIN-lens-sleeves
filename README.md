# GRIN lens sleeves
Contains models and G-code for automated milling of sleeves for GRIN lens of different diameters (e.g. 05025 corresponds to 0.5025 mm inner diameter that will fit a 0.5 mm GRIN lens). 

The G-code has been tested on the Pocket NC V2-10. In theory, the stl files can be 3D printed assuming your printer's precision is sufficient. 

Once manufactured, you have to glue the sleeves onto the GRIN lenses. My typical workflow is to prepare a clean surface and flip all the sleeves so that the smaller cylinder is on the bottom. In this orientation, the lenses are upside-down relative to how they will be lowered into the brain. Into each sleeve, I slip in a GRIN lens and apply a tiny dab of viscous superglue (important that it's viscous enough that it doesn't seep onto the bottom of the lens). Wait for this to dry and then examine and clean the top and bottom of the GRIN lens with lens paper and optic cleaning solution. 

On surgery day, use this cannula holder (https://stoeltingco.com/Neuroscience/Cannula-Holder~9730) to grip the smaller diameter cylinder of the GRIN lens sleeve. Attach the cannula holder to the stereotax and lower your GRIN lens to the desired location.
